# Day 3 — Python Refresher & Pandas Basics

## Overview
Day 3 focuses on refreshing **core Python concepts** and learning the **basics of Pandas**, which is the most important library for data analysis in Python.  
The goal is to load datasets, explore data, and understand how Pandas works with tables.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Refresh essential Python syntax
- Understand Pandas Series and DataFrames
- Load CSV datasets using Pandas
- Perform basic data inspection and filtering

---

## Python Refresher

### Topics Covered

## Pandas Basics

### What is Pandas?
Pandas is a Python library used for:
- Working with structured data
- Data cleaning and analysis
- Fast operations on tables

---

### Core Concepts

#### Series
- One-dimensional data structure
- Similar to a single column in a table

#### DataFrame
- Two-dimensional data structure
- Rows and columns (like Excel or SQL tables)

---

### Common Pandas Operations
- Load data using `read_csv`
- View data using `head`
- Check structure using `info`
- Get statistics using `describe`
- Select columns and rows
- Filter data using conditions

---

## Practice Work
- Load IMDB or Netflix dataset
- Check:
  - First 5 rows
  - Dataset shape
  - Column names
- Find missing values
- Filter movies with rating greater than 7
