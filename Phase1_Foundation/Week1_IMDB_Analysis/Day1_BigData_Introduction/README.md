# Day 1 — Big Data Introduction

## Overview
The goal of Day 1 is to understand what **Big Data** is and why it is important in modern data-driven systems.  
This day focuses on concepts, not tools.

---

## What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to very large and complex datasets that cannot be easily handled by traditional tools like Excel or simple programs.

These datasets are:
- Very large in size
- Generated very fast
- Available in many different formats

Because of this, special systems and tools are required to store and process them.

---

## The 3 V’s of Big Data

### 1. Volume
Volume means the **amount of data**.

Examples:
- Millions of user records
- Billions of images and videos
- Years of logs and transactions

Large data size makes storage and processing difficult on a single computer.

---

### 2. Velocity
Velocity means the **speed at which data is generated and processed**.

Examples:
- Live stock market data
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Social media posts every second

High speed data needs fast processing systems.

---

### 3. Variety
Variety means **different types of data**.

Examples:
- Structured data: Tables, CSV files
- Unstructured data: Text, images, videos
- Semi-structured data: JSON, logs

Not all data fits into rows and columns.

---

## Structured vs Unstructured Data

### Structured Data
- Stored in tables
- Fixed rows and columns
- Easy to analyze

Examples:
- Excel files
- SQL databases

### Unstructured Data
- No fixed format
- Harder to analyze directly

Examples:
- Reviews and comments
- Images and videos
- Audio files

---

## Real-World Example: Netflix
Netflix collects data such as:
- What users watch
- Search history
- Likes and dislikes
- Watch time

This data shows:
- Large **Volume**
- High **Velocity**
- Multiple **Varieties**

This makes Netflix data a clear example of Big Data.

## Why Big Data is Important for Data Scientists
Understanding Big Data helps in:
- Choosing the right tools
- Designing scalable systems
- Handling real-world datasets efficiently

Big Data knowledge is required before working with machine learning at scale.

---

## Practice Task
- Write names of 3 applications that use Big Data
- Identify Volume, Velocity, and Variety for each application

---

## Key Takeaways
- Big Data is not just “large data”
- It is defined by Volume, Velocity, and Variety
- Handling Big Data requires special systems and tools
- Strong concepts are more important than tools at this stage
